The [Chain of Responsibility](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/Chain%20of%20Responsibility) pattern 
(also known as chain of command) is a behavioral design pattern which involves a source of **command** objects 
which are sent along a chain of processing **handlers**.

The application, or **client**, composes a chain of handlers and sends the command/request
to the first handler in the chain.
