The [Chain of Responsibility](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/Chain of Responsibility) pattern 
(also known as chain of command) is a behavioral design pattern which involves a source of **command** objects 
which are sent along a chain of processing **handlers**.

to the first handler in the chain.

In this lesson we use the chain of responsibility pattern to build a web server.
