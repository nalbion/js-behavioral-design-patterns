The **chain of responsibility** pattern (also known as chain of command) is a behavioral design pattern which
involves a source of **command** objects which are sent along a chain of processing **handlers**.

The application, or **client**, composes a chain of handlers and sends the command/request
to the first handler in the chain.

In this lesson we use the chain of responsibility pattern to build a web server.
